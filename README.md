# Brickwall API

CSH's website for job finding purposes.

## Overview

This site is written using a [React](https://reactjs.org/) front end, with a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), and uses Sass and JavaScript ES6.

## Local Development

#### Prerequisites:
1. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
2. [React](https://reactjs.org/)

#### Instructions
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `flask run`

The site should now serve locally at `localhost:5000`, and auto-build when you change/create files in the repo!
